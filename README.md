## 🚀 How to Use This Repository

### For Students

1. **Study the Theory**: Start with the `course/` folder materials. Read each module sequentially to build a strong foundation.
2. **Practice Coding**: After understanding the theory, work through the exercises provided in each course module.
3. **Review Lab Solutions**: Check the numbered folders (`01/`, `02/`, etc.) for practical implementations and solutions.
4. **Experiment**: Clone the repository and modify the code to deepen your understanding:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/UmarlyPoeta/DSA_class.git
   cd DSA_class
   ```
5. **Compile and Run**: Most examples are in C++ or Python. Compile C++ files with:
   ```bash
   g++ -std=c++17 -o program file.cpp
   ./program
   ```

### Learning Path

1. Begin with **01_intro_algorithms.md** to understand algorithm analysis
2. Progress through **02_data_structures.md** to learn fundamental data structures
3. Study **03_dynamic_greedy.md** and **04_graph_algorithms.md** for advanced techniques
4. Complete with **05_pattern_matching.md**, **06_sorting_basics.md**, and **07_linear_sorting.md**

### For Self-Study

- Each course module includes exercises ranging from easy to difficult
- Try solving problems before looking at solutions
- Compare your implementations with those in the lab folders
- Use the references section in each module for deeper understanding

## 💡 Tips for Success

> **Tip:** The `course/` folder is your personal knowledge repository. Feel free to:
> - Add your own notes and annotations
> - Implement the pseudocode in your preferred language
> - Create additional examples
> - Solve the exercises and compare with lab solutions

- **Practice regularly** - Algorithms require consistent practice
- **Understand, don't memorize** - Focus on understanding the underlying principles
- **Analyze complexity** - Always consider time and space trade-offs
- **Code it yourself** - Implement algorithms from scratch before using libraries
- **Use visualizations** - Tools like VisuAlgo can help you understand how algorithms work
